This folder contains the baseline models. 

Modules `AKT`, `DKT`, `DKTForgetting` are modified based on [EduKTM](https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduKTM).  
Module `HLR` is refactored into Pytorch based on [halflife-regression](https://github.com/duolingo/halflife-regression).  
Module `PPE` is reproduced based on the original paper.  
Module `learner_model` is for OU process at the early stage. It is not used in the main experiments.  
Note: the modules in `non_verify` are un-tested.
