* Module `EduKTM` is modified based on [EduKTM](https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduKTM).  
* Module `HawkesKT` is modified based on [HawkesKT](https://github.com/THUwangcy/HawkesKT). 
* Module `halflife_regression` is refactored into Pytorch based on [halflife-regression](https://github.com/duolingo/halflife-regression).  
* Module `ppe` is reproduced based on the original paper.  
* Module `learner_model` is for OU process at the early stage. It is not used in the main experiments.
